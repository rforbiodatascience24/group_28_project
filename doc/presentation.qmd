## Introduction

-   2 296 840 new breast cancer patients in 2022[^1].

-   Aim of project: Exploring and analyzing patterns in breast cancer gene expression data.

[^1]: [Breast Cancer Statistics](https://www.wcrf.org/preventing-cancer/cancer-statistics/breast-cancer-statistics/).

## Materials and method

-   The analysis was performed on the dataset "GDC TCGA Breast Cancer (BRCA)" from xenabrowser.net

-   Our data:

    -   Gene expression (RNAseq) and phenotype metadata

Notes: Materials: What data did you use and where did you get it from?

## Methods: Data preparation

-   Data obtained programatically

-   Pivoted the gene expression dataset longer to be more tidy

-   The two datasets were joined on the patient IDs

-   Mutated the dataset to add new columns:

    -   Age groups
    -   Converted days to years for several relevant columns

-   Analytical methods:

    -   Descriptive data analysis, PCA and Linear Modelling

Notes: Methods: Which modelling did you use? Think of the methods section as a recipe for how to go from raw to results =\> Flow chart?

## Methods: Flowchart

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Figure 1: Flowchart presenting an overview of the process from raw data to augmented data'}
knitr::include_graphics(path = here("doc/flowchart_proces.png"))

```


## Descriptive analysis: Overview of the data

::: columns
::: {.column width="49%"}
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Figure 2: Gender and ethnicity distribution within the data'}
knitr::include_graphics(path = here("results/data_description/gender_ethnicity_overview.png"))
```
:::

::: {.column width="51%"}
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Figure 3: Cancer stage distribution within the data'}
 knitr::include_graphics(path = here("results/data_description/people_per_stage.png"))
```
:::

## Descriptive analysis: Vitality

::: {columns}
::: {.column width="45%"}
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Figure 4: Vitality based on cancer type'}
knitr::include_graphics(path = here("results/data_description/cancer_type_vitality_v2.png")) 

```
:::

::: {.column width="45%"}
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Figure 5: Vitality by age'}
knitr::include_graphics(path = here("results/data_description/survival_by_age.png"))
```
:::
:::

## Descriptive analysis: Survival time and prior malignancy

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Figure 6: Survival time by prior malignancy'}
knitr::include_graphics(path = here("results/data_description/days_to_death_prior_malignancy.png"))

```

## Analysis: Linear model

## Analysis: Investigating cancer stages

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Figure 8: Survival time by Cancer Stage'}
knitr::include_graphics(path=here("results/05_01_years_until_death_by_cancer_stage.png"))
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Figure 9: Vital Status by Cancer Stage'}
knitr::include_graphics(path = here("results/05_02_vital_status_by_cancer_stage.png"))
```
:::
:::

## Analysis: PCA

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Figure 9: Principal Component Analysis'}
knitr::include_graphics(path = here("results/06_pca_plot_2.png"))
```

## Discussion:

-   Catching the cancer in an early stage seems to increase chance of survival

-   Limitations and future work

    -   Compare against healthy tissue samples (eg. GTEX)
