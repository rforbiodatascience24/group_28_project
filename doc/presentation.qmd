## Materials and method

-   The analysis was performed on the dataset "GDC TCGA Breast Cancer (BRCA)"
-   We included data on gene expression RNAseq and phenotype

```{r}
#| output: false
raw_dir <- here("data/_raw/")
data_loc <- "https://gdc-hub.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/download/"
download_file(raw_dir, 
              data_loc, 
              data_file = "TCGA-BRCA.star_fpkm.tsv.gz", 
              new_file_name = "gene_expression_fpkm.tsv.gz")
```

Materials: What data did you use and where did you get it from? Methods: Which modelling did you use? Think of the methods section as a recipe for how to go from raw to results =\> Flow chart?
